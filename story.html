        <h2>Michael's Story</h2>
        <p>Some love stories are built on mutual affection, but some remain quietly woven into the heart of one.</p>
        <p>From the moment Michael saw Bintu at Vijaya’s College in Kottarakara, Kerala, he knew she was special. They studied side by side, their shared passion for nursing filling their days with discussions, laughter, and encouragement. To Bintu, he was a friend, a constant presence in her journey. But to Michael, she was something more—someone who unknowingly held his heart in her hands.</p>
        <p>He cherished every moment, every smile, every conversation that felt like a lifeline. Yet, his love remained unspoken, tucked away behind kindness and quiet devotion.</p>
        <p>Now, as life moves forward, his feelings remain—a testament to the silent, unwavering love that exists even when it is not returned.</p>
